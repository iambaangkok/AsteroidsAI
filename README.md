# AsteroidsAI
## Introduction
So it was 2022's summer break and I was bored. I have decided to start pursueing my goal of becoming a researcher in neural network / deep learning and those stuff. I thought: "hmm...I should try making a neural network project" and there was already a SnakeAI, a TetrisAI so I decided to make this **AsteroidsAI.** 

## Specifications
* The project will be written in **python3** with **kivy** gui library. 
* I won't be using keras or tensorflow yet. This will all be coded from ground up.
* Actions are instant, meaning no inertia. (for now)
* There will be configurable mutation rate.

## Neurons
* Inputs:
    * Distance to closest asteriod in 16 directions
    * Rotation in degrees of the ship
    * Position (does this matter?)
* Outputs:
    * Left/A - Rotate counter-clockwise
    * Right/D - Rotate clockwise
    * Space - Shoot
    * Up/W - Thrust forward (?)


## Notes
* I'll probably be too lazy and play video games instead.
* Thanks to Greer Viau for inspiring me. I'll probably learn a lot from your SnakeAI project.
