# AsteroidsAI

## PROJECT LEFT UNFINISHED
**I STOPPED DOING THIS**

It has taken too long for me to finish. The code was well organized at first but because I'm in a learning process, with time, i didn't know where to put certain methods or how should I encapsulate each class properly. Plus the attempts to get the genetic algorithm working have now turned the code into a pile of spaghetti.

I've decided that ceasing this project is for the better. I've learned a lot. And it's better for me to use those knowledge to build a better project from the ground up.

Thanks to everyone who stayed along with me and my little summer project.

## Introduction

So it was 2022's summer break and I was bored. I have decided to start pursueing my goal of becoming a researcher in neural network / deep learning and those stuff. I thought: "hmm...I should try making a neural network project" and there was already a SnakeAI, a TetrisAI so I decided to make this **AsteroidsAI.** 

## Specifications
* The project will be written in **python3** with **pygame** library. 
* I won't be using keras or tensorflow. This will all be coded from ground up.
* Actions have acceleration and inertia.
* There will be configurable mutation rate.

## Neurons
* Inputs:
    * Distance to closest asteriod in 16 directions
* Outputs:
    * Left/A - Rotate counter-clockwise
    * Right/D - Rotate clockwise
    * Space - Shoot
    * Up/W - Thrust forward


## Notes
* I'll probably be too lazy and play video games instead.
* Thanks to Greer Viau for inspiring me. I'll probably learn a lot from your [SnakeAI](https://github.com/greerviau/SnakeAI) project.
